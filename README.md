Our visualization shows the differences and similarities between US universities in different
state based on the 3 variables: SAT score, acceptance rate, and mid-career median salary (this is the
map and clustering). It also shows the general trends for universities when comparing 2 of the 3 variables(this
is the regression graphs). In general, it is not surprising to find a positive linear relationship between
acceptance rate and SAT score, or the positive linear relationship between salary and any of those 2 variables,
since usually the more selective universities yield higher-paid graduates. What is of interest though, is the
amount of variation in one variable of universities that are close to each other in the other variable.
One of the most extreme examples of this would be College of the Ozarks, which has acceptance rate of only
9%(less than Cornell, close to Stanford University), but SAT of only 1034 and salary $71,800 (substantially
less than Stanfordâ€™s 1475 and $123000).
In general, we can observe universities like the one above, which is completely out on its own, as well as
universities that are relatively "more efficient" in their paramaters. For example, Stevens Institute of
Technology has a 40% acceptance rate, an SAT of 1300, but a median mid-career salary of $120,000, which is
higher than Cornell's. Obviously Stevens is primarily Engineering-based, and with that profession comes a
higher lifetime salary, but, if one was trying to get into a university and didn't have the credentials for
an Ivy League or a similarly-ranked school, Stevens is one of the best with that acceptance rate and SAT.
This can be discovered by looking at our clustering and regressions, as Stevens is in the categories of Ivy's
for some clustering runs, and a clear outlier on two regression graphs.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, certain schools appear to be less efficient, requiring a higher SAT score
or more harsh admission statistics, only to yield a lower median career salary. Schools like Wellesley College
fit this category (30% acceptance rate, 1410 SAT score, $78,400 mid-career salary).
